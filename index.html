                <p>As Co-founders, we had zero clue on the real time stock levels in our warehouse. It felt like a battle to manually update invoices from EE to Zoho, so that at least some data points can be tracked.</p>
                <p>While we had already implemented <a href="#">CleverBooks</a> I had no clue that they could make this API integration work for us and exactly the way we wanted it to work. Thank you team <a href="#">Rahul Vishwakarma</a> & <a href="#">Yogesh Byahatti</a> for identifying the problem and being so quick with the solution, kudos to the amazing team you have.</p>
